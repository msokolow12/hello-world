# hello-world
Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

I can type text here and it goes here.

I wonder if something happens when I hit enter too many times, or whether that has no effect on the code.
<b>Does HTML work here?</b>
So if I type text here, does it show up in GitHub?
| Fruit     | Yumminess    |

| Apple       | 3/5       |
| Grape      | 4/5       |
Strawberry    | 5/5       |
Text goes here
If I add more text here, then will the commit show up again? One way to find out!
